  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p> <small> Dinehard came as the idle brainchild of three Broz with an enthusiam for cooking but no strong reason to experiment with their usual dishes. Only in the haze of night and alcohol did they discover that people people, humans, would be willing to pay them for good food in novel ways. And so it was the first Dinehard was built. Steeped in the hindsight of irony and popular culture, close friends were wined and dined as a means of ego masturbation. But in that circle jerk was a kernel of the true calling of cooking. To make good, strange food for good, strange friends. <br/>
  Seasonal, course based dishes. Dinehard offers a value priced entry into fine dining without the usual trappings of a restaurant environment. No one here cares about pinkies out.
