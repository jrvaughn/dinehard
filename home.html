  <p> <small>In the squalor of hell, luxury is a rare commodity. Satan, itself, trapped in the wrappings of true hunger, hunger beyond the usual bitter soul, summoned three horsemen to deliver upon it a taste of earthly delight.
  In their toil, they impressed it to pitched tears, its three haunted maws tantalized by a variety of exotic fleshes and flora. Its pleasure was such that, in Satanic fashion, it chose to unleash them upon the world's palette.
  Now, dressed in the broiled blood of the eager dead, reeking of meatsmoke and knivery, they deliver upon us all the hell of taste. <br/>
  Of want.<br/>
   The first. The fourth. The infinite. Dinehard.</small></p>
